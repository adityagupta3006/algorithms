String t always consists of two distinct alternating characters. 
For example, if string t's two distinct characters are x and y, then t could be xyxyx or yxyxy but not xxyy or xyyx.

You can convert some string s to string t by deleting characters from s. 
When you delete a character from s, you must delete all occurrences of it in . 
For example, if s= abaacdabd and you delete the character a, then the string becomes bcdbd.

Given s, convert it to the longest possible string t. 
Then print the length of string  on a new line; if no string t can be formed from s, print o instead.
