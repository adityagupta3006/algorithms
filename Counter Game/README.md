# Counter Game.
Louise and Richard play a game. They have a counter set to N. 
In every game, Louise gets the first turn and the turns alternate thereafter. 
In the game, they perform the following operations.

* If N is not a power of 2, reduce the counter by the largest power of 2 less than .
* If N is a power of 2, reduce the counter by half of N.
* The resultant value is the new N which is again used for subsequent operations.
* The game ends when the counter reduces to 1, i.e., N==1, and the last person to make a valid move wins.
* Given N, your task is to find the winner of the game.
* If they set counter to , Richard wins, because its Louise' turn and she cannot make a move.
